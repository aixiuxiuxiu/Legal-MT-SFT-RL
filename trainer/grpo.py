        Generate completions for a batch to be used as training inputs.

        The same inputs are used for multiple generations.
        While some implementations try to do some elaborate batching, it is much
        simpler to just use the same as the training batch, but execute the whole
        batch multiple times.

        Inputs must be left padded!

        Note: This keeps the tokenised output, which can be used directly for the
        actual forward pass to the model containing the loss calculations.
        However, since the inputs might have padding and the output might have different
        amounts of padding, it could save memory when batching them after the fact.

        For example the following could occur:
            <pad><pad><pad>What is 2+2?<assistant>The result of the equation is 4.
            What is 2+2*10?<assistant>22<pad><pad><pad><pad>

        In this case, the first sample has 3 padding tokens in the beginning, because
        the original input was shorter, and the second one has 4 padding tokens at the
        end because the output is shorter. Instead of having to add padding to the
        second, the first one could be shifted to the left, which then only requires
        1 padding token at the end of the second sample. In essence, there should at
        least one sample with zero padding (the longest one).

        While this is clearly not ideal, it would be much more effort to retokenise
        everything, as the images would also need to be included again.

        Args:
            batch (Batch): Batch of inputs to generate completions. This is used like
                during inference, but allows to generate multiple completions for the
                group rewards.
            num (int): Number of completions to generate for each sample in the batch.
